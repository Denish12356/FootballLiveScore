# FootballLiveScore
I have tried to make a football live match scores website instead of the cricket based one since I am not much interested in the sport and also do not know much about it.
I used HTML, CSS and Js for the website and also used axios the get the data from the API.
The API I have used is V3 Football API that allows only 100 requests per day.
Also the desigh isn't very appealing beacuse I didn't get much time to think about it.
I had just completed studying the API part and jumped into this project which was not very easy for me but also taught me much.
